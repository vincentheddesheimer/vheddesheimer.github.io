  <p>I am a Ph.D. student at the Department of Politics at <a href="https://politics.princeton.edu/">Princeton University</a>. My research lies at the intersection of Comparative Politics and Political Economy. I study  working on inequality related to ownership of financial assets, housing financialization, and monetary policy. I am studying these topics using formal theory and paying close attention to causal identification in quasi-experimental settings. </p>

<b><a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cmfvb/">Economic Insecurity Increases Polarization andDecreases Trust

</a></b>
 (With Joanna Bryson and Vishali Sairam).

<i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('polarization');">[Abstract]</a></i>
<div id="polarization" style="display:none;"><br> The causes of polarization and distrust are not well understood, and subject to competing hypotheses. Here we test empirically whether economic precarity is a cause. Precarity is thought to increase both political polarization and distrust due to individual risk aversion. We empirically test predictions of this hypothesis globally at both macro, country and micro, individual levels.  Further, we exploit exogenous variation in European individuals' exposure to Chinese import shocks to establish a causal relation between economic insecurity and decreasing trust. We find that economic insecurity, in the form of income inequality and unemployment at the macro-level, and perceived economic insecurity at the individual level, are associated with increases of affective polarization, and of public distrust. Our work indicates the importance of social safety nets for maintaining social cohesion.

<b><a Securing Markets Through Different Means: The Choice of Intervention Strategies in Civil Wars</a></b>.

<i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('securing');">[Abstract]</a></i>
<div id="securing" style="display:none;"><br> Foreign powers possess different policy tools for intervening in foreign civil wars, such as mediation, the imposition of sanctions, and the deployment of military forces. Although security concerns arguably play a decisive role for intervention decisions, recent studies have shown that economic interests shape such decisions as well. In this article I develop a theoretical framework of the decision in favor of particular intervention strategies that highlights the role of economic interests. These interests are determined by the composition of the economic interrelation between a potential intervener and a civil war state and influence intervention decisions through political pressure by private economic actors affected by foreign conflict. I examine this relation for all civil wars from 1990 to 2015. Higher amounts of exports, imports of capital goods and natural resources, as well as foreign direct investment outflows are associated with an increase in the likelihood of military intervention and a decrease in the probability of economic sanctions. In contrast, larger imports of consumption goods that are in direct competition with domestic producers tend to lead to economic coercion and decrease the odds of the deployment of military personnel.

<b><a Variation in Climate Change Attention and the Political Behavior of Firms</a></b>
(with Christian Baehr and Fiona Bare)
<i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('climate');">[Abstract]</a></i>
<div id="climate" style="display:none;"><br> The private sector plays a critical role in climate politics, and companies use a range of tactics to influence policy development and implementation. When do firms engage in climate-related political activity, and if they do, what determines the types of policies they support? Firms facing high regulatory costs should lobby against pro-climate regulation, while those which pay more attention to physical risks or opportunities from climate change relative to their competitors should lobby in favor of such policies. To test this expectation, we utilize firm-level quarterly earnings call data from 2002-2020 to understand the level of climate attention and relative risk-opportunity attention for over 10,000 public firms. We estimate the effect of variation in climate attention on the type and level of political behavior used to influence climate policy, focusing on lobbying activity in the US. We find that greater overall attention to climate change increases the likelihood that firms engage in any environmental lobbying, and that differences in attention to physical risks, regulatory risks, and market opportunities explain across and within-industry variation of lobbying activity.
